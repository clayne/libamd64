amd64lib is an assembler and disassembler library for the AMD64 architecture.

To generate code, use an AMD64Assembler object and call the various write
functions on it.

To disassemble code, call the static function AMD64Assembler::disassemble.

This library depends on phosg (https://www.github.com/fuzziqersoftware/phosg).
Build and install phosg, then run `make && sudo make install` in this directory.
